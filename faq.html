                <h3>Can I change my regular pick up day permanently?</h3>
                <p>
                  Yes! You can change it by sending an email to wateroperations@psafirstservices.com. 
                  Make sure to specify your name, regular pick up day, and new pick up day.
                </p>

                <h3>What are service days?</h3>
                <p>
                  Drinks are delivered Monday through Thursday. We do not make deliveries on any other days.
                </p>

                <h3>I haven’t received my water yet and it is already 8 PM on my service date, what do I do?</h3>
                <p>
                  Contact wateroperations@psafirstservices.com and customerrelations@psafirstservices.com 
                  to see if either you were not scheduled for a water delivery or if it is running late. 
                  We’ll rectify the problem if there is one and get water to you immediately!
                </p>

                <h3>Will my water be safe outside my door?</h3>
                <p>
                  Yes! firstServices offers a very safe and secure water service. Just make sure 
                  you do not leave the water out overnight and instead, retrieve it shortly after 
                  we’ve delivered it.
                </p>

                <h3>What about fraternities/sororities/off campus housing? Can you deliver to my house?</h3>
                <p>
                  Yes.  However, access to your residence’s front door must be provided in order 
                  for us to deliver your water. Specify this information in the comment box at 
                  the bottom of the registration page. We cannot arrange special times for drop-off 
                  as this creates great disturbances in our operations.
                </p>

                <h3>Will I be provided with a water dispenser if I get the Eco-friendly plan?</h3>
                <p>
                  Yes! You will receive a hot and cold tabletop dispenser along with your first 
                  delivery. If you do not plan on returning at the end of the semester, we will 
                  collect the dispenser.
                </p>

                <h3>I’m not sure If I want a plan; do you offer 24-packs and 3-gallon jugs separately?</h3>
                <p>
                  Yes. You can purchase 24-packs individually! The cost is $22.99 per 24-pack 
                  and $15.99 per 3-gallon jug. You can purchase them from <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.

                  Make sure to specify your name, regular pick up day and desired new pick up day.

                <h3>How much laundry can I wash at once?</h3>
                <p>
                  As much as you want- within reason! Each bag is designed to hold a maximum of 
                  27 lbs of laundry and should close easily to ensure no clothing items are lost! 
                  If there is too much laundry in the bag (i.e. the bag can not close completely), 
                  we will not pick up the bag in order to ensure that your clothes do not fall out 
                  and get lost in transit. So make sure your bag closes completely!
                </p>
                
                <h3>How do I get my laundry bag?</h3>
                <p>
                  We will deliver your bag to your room before your service starts. If your old 
                  bag is worn out, damaged, or lost you can purchase a new one for $10 at our 
                  storefront. Otherwise, please email 
                  <a href="mailto:customerrelations@psafirstservices.com">customerrelations@psafirstservices.com</a>.
                </p>
                  
                <h3>I forgot to leave my laundry outside before 9:00 AM on my scheduled day, what do I do?</h3>
                <p>
                  No problem! If you forgot to leave your bag outside your door, request a 
                  rescheduled laundry pick-up here. Please fill out the form prior to 10 pm 
                  the night before the requested day for pick up. Alternatively, if you really
                  need your laundry that day, you can email
                  <a href="mailto:customerrelations@psafirstservices.com">customerrelations@psafirstservices.com</a> 
                  and see what we can do to help. More than likely, you will be allowed to drop 
                  off your laundry as long as it is before 2 pm.
                </p>
                
                <h3>What happens if something gets lost?</h3>
                <p>
                  firstServices prides itself on quality services. If any issue occurs, 
                  we do everything in our power to make things right! We have a Clothing 
                  Reimbursement Schedule as part of our Customer Service Agreement where 
                  firstServices insures lost or damaged clothing up to $300 per bag. 
                  Please let us know of the situation within 48 hours in order to be eligible 
                  for a refund and to increase the chances of us locating the item.

                <h3>What about fraternities/sororities/off campus housing? Can you deliver to my house?</h3>
                <p>
                  Yes. However, access to your residence’s front door must be provided in order 
                  for us to safely pick-up and deliver your laundry. Specify this information 
                  in the comment box at the bottom of the registration page and reach out to 
                  <a href="mailto:laundryoperations@psafirstservices.com">laundryoperations@psafirstservices.com</a>,

                <h3>I’m not sure I want a plan; do you offer one-time laundry services?</h3>
                <p>
                  Yes, we offer a Pay-As-You-Go (drop-offs) service. In order to use this service, 
                  purchase a firstServcices laundry bag for $10, load up your bag with dirty laundry, 
                  and bring it into the PSA Store located at 117 Williams Hall before 2 PM on any 
                  service day. We will wash & fold the laundry and it will be available for pick-up 
                  after 3 PM the following day. The cost is $1.99 per lb of laundry and payment is due at pickup.

                <p>
                  If you are a dry-cleaning customer, we will deliver your bag to your room 
                  before the start of the semester. If you do not receive a bag, please email 
                  <a href="mailto:executive@psafirstservices.com">executive@psafirstservices.com</a>.
                  If you sign up for dry-cleaning later in the semester, we will deliver your bag to

                <h3>My shirt came back stained?</h3>
                <p>

                  notify you of any preexisting damages. There is no process during dry cleaning 
                  that should stain your item. However, if you believe this is the case for your item, 
                  please reach out to <a href="mailto:customerrelations@psafirstservices.com">customerrelations@psafirstservices.com</a>

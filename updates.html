       <h3>November 12th, 2020</h3>
        <p>
         We hope that this semester has gone as well as it could have possibly gone given these unusually
         difficult circumstances. 
         </p> 
         <p>
         Per our operations email sent on August 28th, firstServices will be ending service after laundry
         drop offs on Thursday, November 19th. The last pick up day will be Tuesday, November 17th.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, fS is preparing to resume operations that resemble what we are known for. More updates
          on operations will be given as the school finalizes the reopening plans for next semester. We hope
          to keep you updated as to our service offerings in the coming weeks. 
        </p>

          With the recent announcement from the University, we would like to announce that firstServices
          will no longer be providing services for on campus customers this semester. We will continue to
          provide only our laundry services to off campus residents.
          </p>
          <p>
          Students and parents that have already purchased an on campus plan will be refunded in the coming
          weeks. As always, firstServices goal is to provide time saving services to the Penn community in a
          safe manner, and so we will continue to offer laundry plans for off campus students. Our 20% off
          offer is still ongoing.
          </p>
          <p>
          Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions and check out our website for any new updates.

          Take care and have a safe semester.

        <p>
          With the recent announcement of housing assignments, firstServices would like to remind the 
          Penn community of our commitment to convenient laundry, water, and dry cleaning services. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We will be in operation for this upcoming school year, however, our operations will be modified
          slightly in order to be compliant with the University's safety guidelines of limiting outside 
          access inside dorm buildings. Since we are unable to enter residential hallways, we will have
          to temporarily suspend our door-to-door delivery service for on-campus residents. Because of this,
          we will be providing on campus students a new plan this semester. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Students living on campus will still be able to use our time saving services as long as they drop 
          off and pick up their laundry from our main office, which is conveniently located in Williams Hall,
          across the street from the Quad. On-campus residents are also welcome to purchase individual packs
          of water bottles from our main office.   
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular operations will still be continuing for off-campus residents. Our services are available 
          to students residing within the Penn Patrol Zone and we are looking to expand further. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To accommodate these service adjustments, we will be offering 20% off all plans (suite, laundry,
          and water plans) until August 30th. To redeem, purchase a plan at regular price, email us at 
          <a href="mailto:customerrelations@psafirstservices.com">customerrelations@psafirstservices.com</a>
          about the promotion, we will verify your purchase and refund you the correct amount. Please visit our newly 
          designed website: <a href="https:https://psafirstservices.com/" target="_blank">https://psafirstservices.com/</a> 
          to get more information and don't hesitate to contact us with any questions.

        <h3>July 13th, 2020</h3>
        <p>
          We hope you and your family are still staying safe this summer. We would like to update you 
          all given the University’s announcement that we will be on campus with a hybrid format. 
          We understand that maintaining safe and sanitary practices is everyone’s concern and firstServices 
          is prepared to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our customers and our employees. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We would like to assure you all that our laundry vendor, WeWashIt, is currently operating 
          in the Philadelphia community using safe and sanitary practices. All laundry and laundry bags 
          have been and always will be cleaned in separate washing machines using antibacterial/antiviral 
          detergent and high temperature water. WeWashIt has provided Philadelphia with clean laundry 
          for more than 25 years and has always prided themselves on cleanliness. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also created new safety protocols for our associates, some of which include all 
          delivery associates being equipped with a clean set of  gloves and a mask for each shift and 
          cleaning all equipment before and after use. Penn Student Agencies (PSA) will be providing 
          all necessary PPE, hand sanitizers, and wipes, at no cost to student workers.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to resume operations and provide our normal services, but we are ready to operate 
          in whatever capacity that Penn will allow, which includes modified services. Regardless, 
          firstServices is prepared to serve the Penn community, to provide students with employment 
          opportunities, and to teach business and entrepreneurial skills in a safe environment.
